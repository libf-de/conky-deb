[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo.  Since  its
       inception,  Conky has changed significantly from its predecessor, while
       maintaining simplicity and  configurability.  Conky  can  display  just
       about  anything,  either on your root desktop or in its own window. Not
       only does Conky have many built-in objects, it can  also  display  just
       about any piece of information by using scripts and other external pro‚Äê
       grams.

       Conky has more than 250 built  in  objects,  including  support  for  a
       plethora  of OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage,
       "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a  few),
       built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music
       players (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious), and much much more.   Conky  can
       display  this  info  either  as text, or using simple progress bars and
       graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We are always looking for help, whether  its  reporting  bugs,  writing
       patches,  or writing docs.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to
       make bug reports, feature requests, and  submit  patches,  or  stop  by
       #conky on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or want to contribute.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

[1mCOMPILING[0m
       For  users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you have
       the X development libraries installed. This should be a  package  along
       the  lines  of "libx11-dev" or "xorg-x11-dev" for X11 libs, and similar
       "-dev" format for the other libs required (depending on your  configure
       options).

       Conky  has  (for  some time) been available in the repositories of most
       popular distributions.  Here are some installation instructions  for  a
       few:

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-
       admin/conky" for installation.  There is  also  usually  an  up-to-date
       ebuild within Conky's package or in the git repo.

       Debian,  etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can be
       installed by doing "aptitude install conky".

       Example to compile and run Conky with  all  optional  components  (note
       that some configure options may differ for your system):

       Conky has been tested to be compatible with C99 C, however it  has  not
       been tested with anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work
       with other compilers.

[1mYOU SHOULD KNOW[0m
       Conky is generally very good on resources. That said, the more you  try
       to make Conky do, the more resources it is going to consume.

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".  Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.  You
       can now also do the same with SIGHUP.

       and you can find the sample config file there (/etc/conky/conky.conf).

       You  might  want  to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and then start modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net/

       [1malias  [22mUse this to create aliases of variables. The first  argument  is
              the  new  name, the second the old name, and the other arguments
              are passed on to the variable. Example: If you want to use  $al‚Äê
              pha  instead  of  ${beta gamma delta} then you have to write the
              following: alias alpha beta gamma delta . PS: Instead of  creat‚Äê
              ing  an  alias  in the config you can also use environment vari‚Äê

              output from $exec vars, and various other variables.  Increasing

              TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be
              in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

              [1mcount [22m- total number of connections in the range
              [1mrip [22m- remote ip address
              [1mrhost [22m- remote host name
              [1mrport [22m- remote port number
              [1mrservice [22m- remote service name from /etc/services
              [1mlip [22m- local ip address
              [1mlhost [22m- local host name

              [1mlservice [22m- local service name from /etc/services

              The connection index provides you with access to each connection
              in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for in‚Äê
              dex values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are
              simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index  must
              be omitted. It is required for all other items.

              Examples:
              [1m${tcp_portmon  6881 6999 count} [22m- displays the number of connec‚Äê
              tions in the bittorrent port range
              [1m${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0} [22m- displays the remote host ip of  the
              first sshd connection
              [1m${tcp_portmon  22 22 rip 9} [22m- displays the remote host ip of the
              tenth sshd connection
              [1m${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0} [22m- displays the remote host name of
              the first connection on a privileged port
              [1m${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rport 4} [22m- displays the remote host port of
              the fifth connection on a privileged port
              [1m${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14} [22m- displays the local  service
              name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

              Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
              actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a sin‚Äê
              gle port range for different items and different indexes all use
              the same monitor internally. In other words, the program  avoids
              creating redundant monitors.

       [1mtexeci interval command[0m
              Runs  a  command at an interval inside a thread and displays the
              output. Same as $execi, except  the  command  is  run  inside  a
              thread.  Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky updat‚Äê
              ing. You should make the interval slightly longer then the  time
              it  takes  your  script  to  execute. For example, if you have a
              script that take 5 seconds to execute, you should make  the  in‚Äê
              terval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.


       [1moffset (pixels)[0m

              ing: feed_title, item_title (with num par), item_desc (with  num
              par) and item_titles.


       [1mtab (width, (start))[0m
              Puts a tab of the specified width, starting from column 'start'.
              The unit is pixels for both arguments.


       [1mtail logfile lines (interval)[0m
              Displays last N lines of supplied text text file. If interval is
              not supplied, Conky assumes 2x Conky's interval. Max of 30 lines
              can be displayed, or until the text buffer is filled.


       [1mtemplateN (arg1) (arg2) (arg3 ...)[0m
              Evaluate the content of  the  templateN  configuration  variable
              (where N is a value between 0 and 9, inclusively), applying sub‚Äê
              stitutions as described in the documentation of the  correspond‚Äê
              ing  configuration variable.  The number of arguments is option‚Äê
              al, but must match the highest referred index in  the  template.
              You  can  use the same special sequences in each argument as the
              ones valid for a template definition, e.g. to allow an  argument
              to  contain  a  whitespace.  Also simple nesting of templates is
              possible this way.

              Here are some examples of template definitions:

              template0 $\1\2
              template1 \1: ${fs_used \2} / ${fs_size \2}
              template2 \1 \2

              The following list shows sample usage of the  templates  defined
              above, with the equivalent syntax when not using any template at
              all:

       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with

       been reported that it doesn't work with KDE  either.  Nautilus  can  be
       disabled  from  drawing  to  desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck
       show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is  -w  switch  in
       Conky  to  set  some  specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree
       useful to find the window to draw to. You  can  also  use  -o  argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window. If you do try running Conky
       in its own window, be sure to read up on the  own_window_type  settings
       and experiment.
