NAME
       conky - A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but
       more kickass. It just keeps on givener. Yeah.

SYNOPSIS
       conky [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on  the  torsmo  code.
       Since  its original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from its
       predecessor.  Conky can display just about  anything,  either  on  your
       root  desktop  or in its own window.  Conky has many built-in objects,
       as well as the ability to execute programs and  scripts,  then  display
       the output from stdout.

       We  are	always	looking  for help, and anyone interested in becoming a
       developer is welcome.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make
       bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

COMPILING
       For  users  compiling from source, make sure you have the X development
       libraries installed.  This should be  a	package  along	the  lines  of
       "libx11-dev or xorg-x11-dev".

       Gentoo  users  --  Conky  is  in Gentoos Portage... simply use "emerge
       app-admin/conky" for installation.  There is also usually an up-to-date
       ebuild within Conkys package or in CVS.

       Debian,etc.  users  --  Conky will be in Debians repositories soon (by
       mid-September, hopefully), and then Ubuntu  shortly  thereafter.  Until
       then, "dpkg -i" the .deb package to install.

       To compile and run Conky with all optional components:

       sh autogen.sh # Only required if building from CVS

       ./configure	      --prefix=/usr	       --mandir=/usr/share/man
       --infodir=/usr/share/info    --datadir=/usr/share     --sysconfdir=/etc
       --localstatedir=/var/lib   --enable-double-buffer   --enable-own-window
       --enable-proc-uptime --enable-mpd --enable-xft --enable-seti

       make

       make install # Optional

       src/conky

       Conky  probably	doesnt compile with compilers other than gcc and icc.
       It doesnt compile with C89 compiler and not even with  pure  C99.   It
       uses  a	few things that might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strn
       casecmp(), optarg variable with getopt() and long long  (not  in  C89).
       Crashes in file system statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I dont
       know exactly why.

       You can disable drawing to own window feature in case you dont  need
       it by passing --disable-own-window to configure -script.


YOU SHOULD KNOW
       Conky  is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects in
       Conky are harder on resources then others. In  particular,  the	$tail,
       $top,  $font,  and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison to the
       rest of Conky.

       If you do use them, please do not complain about memory or  CPU	usage,
       unless you think somethings seriously wrong (mem leak, etc.).

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".	Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.

       IMPORTANT: For previous Conky users, Conky 1.3 no longer  supports  the
       metar  stuff.   mdsplib	was  causing  way too many problems. Hopefully
       therell be a better solution in Conky 2.x...

OPTIONS
       Command line options override configurations defined  in  configuration
       file.

       -v | -V
	      Prints version and exits


       -a ALIGNMENT
	      Text alignment on screen, {top,bottom}_{left,right} or none


       -b     Use double buffering (eliminates "flicker")


       -c FILE
	      Config file to load instead of $HOME/.conkyrc


       -d     Daemonize Conky, aka fork to background


       -f FONT
	      Font to use


       -h     Prints command line help and exits


       -o     Create own window to draw


       -t TEXT
	      Text to render, remember single quotes, like -t  $uptime


       -u SECONDS
	      Update interval


       -w WIN_ID
	      Window id to draw


       -x X_COORDINATE
	      X position


       -y Y_COORDINATE
	      Y position


CONFIGURATION SETTINGS
       Default	configuration  file  is  $HOME/.conkyrc  (can  be changed from
       conky.c among other things). See  conkyrc.sample.  If  installing  from
       Debian  package, this should be in /usr/share/doc/conky/examples ("gun
       zip conkyrc.sample.gz" to get conkyrc.sample).

       You might want to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and	then  start  modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net

	      thread. Use this if you have a slow script to keep Conky	updat
	      ing.  You should make the interval slightly longer then the time
	      it takes your script to execute. For  example,  if  you  have  a
	      script  that  take  5  seconds  to  execute, you should make the
	      interval at least 6 seconds. See also $execi.

BUGS
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesnt work with
       all window managers. Especially doesnt work well with Gnome and it has
       been reported that it doesnt work with KDE  either.  Nautilus  can  be
       disabled  from  drawing	to  desktop with program gconf-editor. Uncheck
       show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is	-w  switch  in
       Conky  to  set  some  specific window id. You might find xwininfo -tree
       useful to find the window to draw to. You  can  also  use  -o  argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window.
