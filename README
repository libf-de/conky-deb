[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on torsmo.  Since  its
       inception,  Conky has changed significantly from its predecessor, while
       maintaining simplicity and  configurability.  Conky  can  display  just
       about  anything,  either on your root desktop or in its own window. Not
       only does Conky have many built-in objects, it can  also  display  just
       about any piece of information by using scripts and other external pro‚Äê
       grams.

       Conky has more than 250 built  in  objects,  including  support  for  a
       plethora  of OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage,
       "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a  few),
       built in IMAP and POP3 support, built in support for many popular music
       players (MPD, XMMS2, BMPx, Audacious), and much much more.   Conky  can
       display  this  info  either  as text, or using simple progress bars and
       graph widgets, with different fonts and colours.

       We are always looking for help, whether  its  reporting  bugs,  writing
       patches,  or writing docs.  Please use the facilities at SourceForge to
       make bug reports, feature requests, and  submit  patches,  or  stop  by
       #conky on irc.freenode.net if you have questions or want to contribute.

       Thanks for your interest in Conky.

[1mCOMPILING[0m
       For  users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you have
       the X development libraries installed. This should be a  package  along
       the  lines  of "libx11-dev" or "xorg-x11-dev" for X11 libs, and similar
       "-dev" format for the other libs required (depending on your  configure
       options).

       Conky  has  (for  some time) been available in the repositories of most
       popular distributions.  Here are some installation instructions  for  a
       few:

       Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-
       admin/conky" for installation.

       Debian, etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can  be
       installed by doing "aptitude install conky".

       Example  to  compile  and  run Conky with all optional components (note
       that some configure options may differ for your system):

       Conky  has  been tested to be compatible with C99 C, however it has not
       been tested with anything other than gcc, and is not guaranteed to work
       with other compilers.

[1mYOU SHOULD KNOW[0m
       Conky  is generally very good on resources. That said, the more you try
       to make Conky do, the more resources it is going to consume.

       An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall -SIGUSR1
       conky".   Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart. You
       can now also do the same with SIGHUP.

[1mCONFIGURATION SETTINGS[0m
       Default   configuration   file   location    is    $HOME/.conkyrc    or
       ${sysconfdir}/conky/conky.conf.  On  most  systems, sysconfdir is /etc,
       and you can find the sample config file there (/etc/conky/conky.conf).

       You might want to copy it to $HOME/.conkyrc and  then  start  modifying
       it.  Other configs can be found at http://conky.sf.net/

       [1mTEXT   [22mAfter this begins text to be formatted on screen.  Backslash (\)
              escapes newlines in the text section. This  can  be  useful  for
              cleaning  up  config  files where conky is used to pipe input to
              dzen2.


       [1malias  [22mUse this to create aliases of variables. The first  argument  is
              the  new  name, the second the old name, and the other arguments
              are passed on to the variable.  Example: If you want to use $al‚Äê
              pha  instead  of  ${beta gamma delta} then you have to write the
              following: alias alpha beta gamma delta . PS: Instead of  creat‚Äê
              ing  an  alias  in the config you can also use environment vari‚Äê
              ables. Example: Start conky like this: alpha="beta gamma  delta"

       [1mplatform (dev) type n (factor offset)[0m
              Platform  sensor  from  sysfs  (Linux 2.6). Parameter dev may be
              omitted if you have only one platform device.  Platform type  is
              either  'in' or 'vol' meaning voltage; 'fan' meaning fan; 'temp'
              meaning temperature. Parameter n is number of  the  sensor.  See
              /sys/bus/platform/devices/  on your local computer. The optional
              arguments 'factor' and 'offset' allow precalculation of the  raw
              input, which is being modified as follows: 'input = input * fac‚Äê

              This  is  a  very raw method of accessing the smapi values. When

              when  using smapi, display the current power of the battery with

              TCP port monitor for specified local ports. Port numbers must be
              in the range 1 to 65535. Valid items are:

              [1mcount[22m- total number of connections in the range
              [1mrip[22m- remote ip address
              [1mrhost[22m- remote host name
              [1mrport[22m- remote port number
              [1mrservice[22m- remote service name from /etc/services
              [1mlip[22m- local ip address
              [1mlhost[22m- local host name
              [1mlport[22m- local port number
              [1mlservice[22m- local service name from /etc/services

              The connection index provides you with access to each connection
              in the port monitor. The monitor will return information for in‚Äê
              dex values from 0 to n-1 connections. Values higher than n-1 are
              simply ignored. For the "count" item, the connection index  must
              be omitted. It is required for all other items.

              Examples:
              [1m${tcp_portmon  6881  6999 count}[22m- displays the number of connec‚Äê
              tions in the bittorrent port range
              [1m${tcp_portmon 22 22 rip 0}[22m- displays the remote host ip  of  the
              first sshd connection
              [1m${tcp_portmon  22  22 rip 9}[22m- displays the remote host ip of the
              tenth sshd connection
              [1m${tcp_portmon 1 1024 rhost 0}[22m- displays the remote host name  of
              the first connection on a privileged port
              [1m${tcp_portmon  1 1024 rport 4}[22m- displays the remote host port of
              the fifth connection on a privileged port
              [1m${tcp_portmon 1 65535 lservice 14}[22m- displays the  local  service
              name of the fifteenth connection in the range of all ports

              Note that port monitor variables which share the same port range
              actually refer to the same monitor, so many references to a sin‚Äê
              gle port range for different items and different indexes all use
              the same monitor internally.  In other words, the program avoids
              creating redundant monitors.

       [1mtemplateN (arg1) (arg2) (arg3 ...)[0m
              Evaluate  the  content  of  the templateN configuration variable
              (where N is a value between 0 and 9, inclusively), applying sub‚Äê
              stitutions  as described in the documentation of the correspond‚Äê
              ing configuration variable.  The number of arguments is  option‚Äê
              al,  but  must match the highest referred index in the template.
              You can use the same special sequences in each argument  as  the
              ones  valid for a template definition, e.g. to allow an argument
              to contain a whitespace. Also simple  nesting  of  templates  is
              possible this way.

              Here are some examples of template definitions:

              template0 $\1\2
              template1 \1: ${fs_used \2} / ${fs_size \2}
              template2 \1 \2

              The  following  list shows sample usage of the templates defined
              above, with the equivalent syntax when not using any template at
              all:

[1mBUGS[0m
       Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with
       all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has
       been  reported  that  it  doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be
       disabled from drawing to desktop  with  program  gconf-editor.  Uncheck
       show_desktop  in  /apps/nautilus/preferences/.  There  is  -w switch in
       Conky to set some specific window id. You  might  find  xwininfo  -tree
       useful  to  find  the  window  to draw to. You can also use -o argument
       which makes Conky to create its own window. If you do try running Conky
       in  its  own window, be sure to read up on the own_window_type settings
       and experiment.
