conky (1.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    conky-std now includes support for RSS, weather (both METAR and XOAP),
    imlib2, and all Lua bindings. This is a compromise for users who do not
    wish to have contrib enabled on their systems to install conky-all, yet
    would like the most common features from the conky-all package.

    Also, both conky-all and conky-std now include support for Audacious
    and XMMS2.

    Package maintenance moved back to Debian.
    Debian users, please be aware that 3 binary packages are now created:
    conky-cli, conky-std and conky-all.

    with dzen2.
    It includes the following support:

    MPD, MOC, math, apcupsd, ncurses and I/O stats

    conky-std should be a good compromise for most users that do not
    need special features.
    It includes the following support:

    X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon,
    wireless, ALSA mixer, apcupsd, I/O stats and lua

    conky-all includes almost all of the available support:

    X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon, RSS, curl,
    Weather (METAR and XOAP), wireless, IBM, nvidia, eve-online, Imlib2,
    ALSA mixer, apcupsd, I/O stats, Lua and Lua bindings for the cairo
    and imlib2 libraries.

    Note that some features might not be available for non-linux kernels
    or non i386, amd64 CPUs.

conky (1.7.0-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

    The sample version of the config file is not distributed anymore.
    A number of features and fixes have been added since the previous

    a sample version of this file is in the doc/examples directory.
    A number of features and fixes have been added since the previous
    release as documented in the man page and the upstream changelog.

conky (1.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The previous version of "conky" packaged for Debian was 1.4.4
    so there have been a number of changes to "conky" and its
    configuration in the intervening period. Please look at the
    upstream documentation (Changelog, NEWS, man pages) for further
    details.

    Some new config parameters have been added but if you have a
    configuration file for version 1.4.4-1 it should work without any
    problems with this version. If it does not, please report it as a
    bug to the Debian BTS.

    Some of the notable additions to "conky" are build-time options
    that support "audacious", "beep media player", "RSS feeds" and
    "wireless devices". These are *not* enabled in the current Debian
    packaging. Users who want these features will have to re-build
    "conky" with appropriate changes.

    The hard-coded default configuration of "conky" shows the tail of
    the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log. However, this causes "conky" to
    exit with an error for those users who do not have such a file or
    do not have access to it. The Debian version of "conky" disables
    this portion of the hard-coded configuration.

    One of the significant upstream changes is "Clarifying
    licensing". This is documented further in the "copyright" file in
    this directory.
