conky (1.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Users may find that older conky configuration files give
    unexpected results. Specifically,

     - mixer values are percentages
     - new variables out_to_x, overwrite_file, append_file,
       out_to_stderr
     - IBM acpi support is no longer compiled in by default in the
       Debian package.
     - changed order of arguments for diskiograph
     - maximum width for mpd variables
     - remove freq_dyn and freq_dyn_g
     - conky in dock mode is a withdrawn window

    See the example "conky.conf" file and the man page for
    further guidance.

conky (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Users may find that older conky configuration files give
    unexpected results. This is because some buffer sizes have been
    "optimized". For the details about these changes please refer
    to the man page.

conky (1.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The previous version of "conky" packaged for Debian was 1.4.4
    so there have been a number of changes to "conky" and its
    configuration in the intervening period. Please look at the
    upstream documentation (Changelog, NEWS, man pages) for further
    details.

    Some new config parameters have been added but if you have a
    configuration file for version 1.4.4-1 it should work without any
    problems with this version. If it does not, please report it as a
    bug to the Debian BTS.

    Some of the notable additions to "conky" are build-time options
    that support "audacious", "beep media player", "RSS feeds" and
    "wireless devices". These are *not* enabled in the current Debian
    packaging. Users who want these features will have to re-build
    "conky" with appropriate changes.

    The hard-coded default configuration of "conky" shows the tail of
    the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log. However, this causes "conky" to
    exit with an error for those users who do not have such a file or
    do not have access to it. The Debian version of "conky" disables
    this portion of the hard-coded configuration.

    One of the significant upstream changes is "Clarifying
    licensing". This is documented further in the "copyright" file in
    this directory.
