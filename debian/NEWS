conky (1.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Conky 1.10.0 introduces a new Lua-based configuration format, which
    supersedes the older free-form text format. An example can be found in
    /usr/share/doc/conky-{std,cli,all}/conky.conf, and documented at [1][2].
    You may attempt to convert your old conkyrc by using a Lua script that can
    be found at /usr/share/doc/conky-{std,cli,all}/convert.lua.

    Support for the older pre-1.10.0 conkyrc format will continue to be
    enabled in the Debian packages for as long as it is supported and
    maintained upstream.

conky (1.9.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

    src:conky-all has been merged into src:conky, including all binary
    packages built by the former (conky-all), now that libxnvctrl and
    nvidia-settings has been moved to main; see [#747837] for background wrt
    nvidia-settings, and [#579102] for rationale as to why the conky vs.
    conky-all source package split was necessary in the first place.

    For end users, this means that:
    - Support for RSS, weather (both METAR and XOAP), imlib2, and all Lua
      bindings are disabled in conky-std. These features (which are not
      enabled by default upstream) are all enabled in conky-all instead.
    - conky-all has been moved to main. You should install this package if
      you need the above features.

    This means that support for features in the various conky binary packages
    are effectively the same as in versions prior to 1.8.1-3 before the split.

conky (1.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

    conky-std now includes support for RSS, weather (both METAR and XOAP),
    imlib2, and all Lua bindings. This is a compromise for users who do not
    wish to have contrib enabled on their systems to install conky-all, yet
    would like the most common features from the conky-all package.

    Also, both conky-all and conky-std now include support for Audacious
    and XMMS2.

conky (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Package maintenance moved back to Debian.
    Debian users, please be aware that 3 binary packages are now created:
    conky-cli, conky-std and conky-all.

    conky-cli is a basic package that can be useful in servers or piped
    with dzen2.
    It includes the following support:

    MPD, MOC, math, apcupsd, ncurses and I/O stats

    conky-std should be a good compromise for most users that do not
    need special features.
    It includes the following support:

    X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon,
    wireless, ALSA mixer, apcupsd, I/O stats and lua

    conky-all includes almost all of the available support:

    X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon, RSS, curl,
    Weather (METAR and XOAP), wireless, IBM, nvidia, eve-online, Imlib2,
    ALSA mixer, apcupsd, I/O stats, Lua and Lua bindings for the cairo
    and imlib2 libraries.

    Note that some features might not be available for non-linux kernels
    or non i386, amd64 CPUs.

    The sample version of the config file is not distributed anymore.
    A number of features and fixes have been added since the previous

    The system default config file for conky is an external
    conffile '/etc/conky/conky.conf' (since upstream version 1.4.9) 
    a sample version of this file is in the doc/examples directory.
    A number of features and fixes have been added since the previous
    release as documented in the man page and the upstream changelog.

    Since enabling the wireless support meant adding "only" 62K of
    library dependency it has been enabled in this build.

conky (1.4.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

    The previous version of "conky" packaged for Debian was 1.4.4
    so there have been a number of changes to "conky" and its
    configuration in the intervening period. Please look at the
    upstream documentation (Changelog, NEWS, man pages) for further
    details.

    Some new config parameters have been added but if you have a
    configuration file for version 1.4.4-1 it should work without any
    problems with this version. If it does not, please report it as a
    bug to the Debian BTS.

    Some of the notable additions to "conky" are build-time options
    that support "audacious", "beep media player", "RSS feeds" and
    "wireless devices". These are *not* enabled in the current Debian
    packaging. Users who want these features will have to re-build
    "conky" with appropriate changes.

    The hard-coded default configuration of "conky" shows the tail of
    the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log. However, this causes "conky" to
    exit with an error for those users who do not have such a file or
    do not have access to it. The Debian version of "conky" disables
    this portion of the hard-coded configuration.

    One of the significant upstream changes is "Clarifying
    licensing". This is documented further in the "copyright" file in
    this directory.
