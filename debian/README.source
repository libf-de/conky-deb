Please note that this source package will produce 3 different binary
packages, with 3 different configuration, compilation and installation runs.

These packages are: conky-cli, conky-std and conky-all.

conky-cli
---------

conky-cli is a basic package that can be useful in servers or piped with dzen2.
At this time it includes the following support:

MPD, MOC, math, apcupsd, ncurses and I/O stats.

These are basically all the features enabled by default upstream
minus those that requires X11 or a 3rd party library (beside the standard
C one and ncurses).

conky-std
---------

conky-std should be a good compromise for most users that do not need special
features.
At this time it includes the following support:

X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon, RSS,
Weather, wireless, Imlib2, ALSA mixer, apcupsd, I/O stats, argb, Lua
and the cairo and imlib2 lua bindings, Audacious, and XMMS2.

conky-all
---------

conky-all includes almost all of the available support:

X11, XDamage, XDBE, Xft, MPD, MOC, math, hddtemp, portmon, RSS,
Weather, wireless, IBM, nvidia, eve-online, Imlib2, ALSA mixer,
apcupsd, I/O stats, argb, Lua and the cairo and imlib2 lua bindings,
Audacious, and XMMS2.

Please check upstream documentation and source files when updating this
package, some features might be removed or changed, others added, so that
any update will stick to this general philosophy.
