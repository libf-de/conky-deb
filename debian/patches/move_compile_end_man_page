 Thanks for your interest in Conky.
-.SH COMPILING
-For users compiling from source, make sure you have the X development libraries installed. 
-This should be a package along the lines of "libx11-dev or xorg-x11-dev". 
-.PP
-Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-admin/conky" for installation.
-There is also usually an up-to-date ebuild within Conky's package or in Svn.
-.PP
-Debian,etc. users -- Conky will be in Debian's repositories soon (by mid-September, hopefully), and then 
-Ubuntu shortly thereafter. Until then, "dpkg \-i" the .deb package to install.

-Conky probably doesn't compile with compilers other than gcc and icc. 
-It doesn't compile with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99.
-It uses a few things that might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strncasecmp(), 
-optarg variable with getopt() and long long (not in C89). Crashes in file system
-statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't know exactly why.
-.PP
-You can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't need it by passing 
-\-\-disable\-own\-window to configure script.
