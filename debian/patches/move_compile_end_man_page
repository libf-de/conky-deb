 Thanks for your interest in Conky.

-For users compiling from source on a binary distro, make sure you have the X development
-libraries installed. This should be a package along the lines of "libx11-dev" or
-"xorg-x11-dev" for X11 libs, and similar "-dev" format for the other libs required (depending
-on your configure options).

-Conky has (for some time) been available in the repositories of most popular distributions.
-Here are some installation instructions for a few:

-Gentoo users -- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app-admin/conky" for installation.
-There is also usually an up-to-date ebuild within Conky's package or in SVN.

-Debian, etc. users -- Conky should be in your repositories, and can be installed by doing
-"aptitude install conky".
