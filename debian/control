Description: highly configurable system monitor for X based on torsmo
 Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code.
 Since its original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from its
 predecessor. Conky can display just about anything, either on your
 root desktop or in its own window. Conky has many built-in objects,
 as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, then display
 the output from stdout.
