Heres a very simplified roadmap for Conky.  By no means does this mean any of this stuff will actually get implemented.

1.3.0 - probably end of august/beginning of sept
	* make it rock-solid
	* release ASAP

after 1.3.0 only maintenance releases will follow, no new features for the 1.x series

2.0.0 - hopefully by christmas at the latest
	* rewrite core of Conky in C++
	* implement new features like a cairo backend, network transparency, and whatever else
