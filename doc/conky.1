.SH NAME
conky \- A system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code, but more kickass. It just keeps on given'er. Yeah.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconky\fR [\fBoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code. 
Since it's original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from it's predecessor. 
Conky can display just about anything, either on your root desktop or in it's own window. 
Conky has many built\-in objects, as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, 
then display the output from stdout.
.PP
We are always looking for help, and anyone interested in becoming a developer is welcome. 
Please use the facilities at SourceForge to make bug reports, feature requests, and submit patches.
.PP
Thanks for your interest in Conky.
.SH COMPILING
For users compiling from source, make sure you have the X development libraries installed. 
This should be a package along the lines of "libx11\-dev or xorg\-x11\-dev". 
.PP
Gentoo users \-\- Conky is in Gentoo's Portage... simply use "emerge app\-admin/conky" for installation.
There is also usually an up\-to\-date ebuild within Conky's package or in CVS.
.PP
Debian,etc. users \-\- Conky will be in Debian's repositories soon (by mid\-September, hopefully), and then 
Ubuntu shortly thereafter. Until then, "dpkg \-i" the .deb package to install. 
.PP
To compile and run Conky with all optional components:
.TP 
\fBsh autogen.sh\fR \fB# Only required if building from CVS\fR 
.TP 
\fB\&./configure \fR\fB\-\-prefix=/usr \-\-mandir=/usr/share/man \-\-infodir=/usr/share/info \-\-datadir=/usr/share \-\-sysconfdir=/etc \-\-localstatedir=/var/lib \-\-enable\-double\-buffer \-\-enable\-own\-window \-\-enable\-proc\-uptime \-\-enable\-mpd \-\-enable\-xft \-\-enable\-seti\fR 
.TP 
\fBmake\fR 
.TP 
\fBmake install\fR \fB# Optional\fR 
.TP 
\fBsrc/conky\fR 
.PP
Conky probably doesn't compile with compilers other than gcc and icc. 
It doesn't compile with C89 compiler and not even with pure C99.
It uses a few things that might not exist: strdup(), strcasecmp(), strncasecmp(), 
optarg variable with getopt() and long long (not in C89). Crashes in file system
statistics stuff when compiled with icc, I don't know exactly why.
.PP
You can disable 'drawing to own window' feature in case you don't need it by passing 
\-\-disable\-own\-window to configure \-script.
.PP
.SH "YOU SHOULD KNOW"
Conky is generally very good on resources. However, certain objects in
Conky are harder on resources then others. In particular, the $tail,
$top, $font, and $graph objects are quite costly in comparison to the rest of Conky.
.PP
If you do use them, please do not complain about memory or CPU usage, 
unless you think something's seriously wrong (mem leak, etc.).
.PP
An easy way to force Conky to reload your ~/.conkyrc: "killall \-SIGUSR1 conky".
Saves you the trouble of having to kill and then restart.
.PP
IMPORTANT: For previous Conky users, Conky 1.3 no longer supports the metar stuff. 
mdsplib was causing way too many problems. Hopefully there'll be a better solution in Conky 2.x...

.SH BUGS
Drawing to root or some other desktop window directly doesn't work with 
all window managers. Especially doesn't work well with Gnome and it has 
been reported that it doesn't work with KDE either. Nautilus can be 
disabled from drawing to desktop with program gconf\-editor. Uncheck 
show_desktop in /apps/nautilus/preferences/. There is \-w switch in Conky 
to set some specific window id. You might find xwininfo \-tree useful to 
find the window to draw to. You can also use \-o argument which makes
Conky to create its own window.
